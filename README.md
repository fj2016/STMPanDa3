#STMPanDa3

Is a simple game as a univeristy project for Microprocessors lab at the Poznan University of Technology. We have a Panda as a player, which can be controlled by an accelerometer built into the STM32F407 Discovery board. All you have to do is catch falling grades from 3 to 5 and your score will increase. When you catch 2 your score will decrease.
